The Jews basically control the country, the congress, the economy the media,” Jones replied.\n\nWhen Camerota began listing Holocaust facts, Jones exclaimed: “Poppycock!”\n\nThe two sparred for a while more, before the New Day host brought an end to the rollercoaster ride.\n\n“Arthur Jones, we’ve heard your opinion and we’ll see what happens,” Camerota concluded. “Chances are, you’ll go down in flames.”\n\nSubscribe News Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx9_YXuD8LLiTXLLT4yJFhA",3,3,0,0,0,

Host Sara Gilbert gets emotional, reading a statement filed against Baio by their co-star Alexander Polinsky, He's a dear friend of mine, Gilbert shares, before she continues reading the statement about Baio acting 'inappropriately' to Eggert on set during the first season, calling him 'various homophobic slurs,' 'I received regular verbal attacks, mental abuse and I also suffered a physical assault at the hands of Scott Baio.' Gilbert asks Eggert, Alexander says he witnessed this the first year of the show, which would make you 14? Eggert responds, 14-years-old, 1986 and before I was 15-years-old, he had me at his home, in his car, in his garage and he penetrated my vagina with his finger and this is where it began and this continued almost on a weekly basis for years. Of course, the abuse progressed from there quite a bit although I remained a virgin until I was 17.\n\nSubscribe To The Talk Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/10hBiIw\nWatch Full Episodes of The Talk HERE: http://bit.ly/Wz3H0U\nFollow “The Talk” on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1OLLdk1\nLike The Talk on Facebook HERE: http://on.fb.me/12v9WlC\nFollow “The Talk” on Instagram HERE: http://bit.ly/1hggnWc\nFollow The Talk on Google+ HERE: http://bit.ly/1SOobzn\n\nGet the CBS app for iPhone & iPad!

We went for a full on Mexican street food tour in Puebla, Mexico, and discovered the most incredible FAST cutting sandwich lady, with the fastest knife cutting skills, kind of like the Super Human Sandwich Fruit Ninja of Mexico, along with amazing tacos with spicy salsa and delicious mole poblano! ALL of the Best Mexican Street Food!\n\nIn this street food tour vlog, we venture outside of Mexico city to Puebla, to eat the best street food in Mexico and taste the world famous Mole sauce over top of juicy chicken. It was spicy, full of chili, and so delicious. \n\nThe Best Street Food we found, was definitely the cemita sandwich from Puebla, which was made by the most amazing woman, the Sandwich Ninja of Mexico! The cemita sandwich was cut so fast with amazing skills, EXTREMELY fast! Her knife skills were incredible, chopping and cutting so fast with the avocado fruit and the chicken as well. The way her hands worked was amazing to watch, and this was just one of the street foods we had in Puebla, Mexico! The Chicken sandwich was so plump and delicious\n\nWe started our street food tour in Mexico in Mexico city, eating a ton of delicious street food in Part 1 and 2 here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dHnqNOvDi44\nhttps://youtu.be/W0Anp0wmXek\n\nAfter this, we spent a day on a street food adventure to go to Puebla, all in search of the famous Mole poblano, but we found so much more.  The first thing we did was visit a local market and try out a bunch of food in the market, like juicy lamb tacos, covered in spicy salsa and then spicy stomach tortilla tacos as well. This is the beauty of Mexican street food, the amazing variation and extreme deliciousness of the cuisine that makes your mouth come alive. \n\nAfter those amazing Mexican tacos, we kept exploring the farmers market even more and found delicious salads and pickled chilies that blew my mouth off, they were so hot and spicy!\n\nAfter this, we found the world famous Mexican Mole Poblano, famous from Puebla that was incredibly flavourful, full of chocolate, chilies, fruit, nuts, cinnamon, and more!\n\nAfter exploring the street food market a little more, we drove to Puebla and found the most amazing sandwich ninja cutting up with super human skill each ingredient and fruit like avocado to put into the sandwich and slice with incredible speed and precision! She was so fast! The sandwich was prepared very fast and it was so delicious as well! She had GOD LEVEL skill, her knife skills were so fast and so fun to watch. \n\nAfter eating the sandwich with the locals and enjoying the flavour, we went on to have one final meal in Puebla, Mexico, except this one wasn't a street food. We wanted to try the stuffed chili pepper, but it wasn't in season! So we had a pumpkin seed sauce over top of pork and it was still fairly delicious.\n\nHere are the addresses for the locations in this street food vlog:\n\n1) Lamb Tacos with delicious spicy salsa - Inside the Cholula Farmers Market near the town square\n2) Amazing Mexican salad bar featuring spicy pickled chipotle chilies and cow feet salad along with Nopales prickly pear cactus salad - Also inside the Cholula farmers market\n3) Mole Poblano rich and dark chocolate sauce with chili, nuts, fruit, and cinnamon - Also found inside the cholula local farmers street food market\n4) Super human fast cutting skills sandwich lady of Mexico - Found in Puebla downtown - Super Cemitas El As De Oros\n5) Pretty delicious but not amazing Pueblan dinner found downtown Puebla\n\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER \n\nMy name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China, eating up as much delicious street food as I can .

A skater seeks out the thinnest, most pristine black ice possible—both for its smoothness, and for its high-pitched, laser-like sounds. \n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Like a dome or arch, the support comes from the sides rather than the top, and the water underneath prevents the ice from breaking. But, experience and careful advance planning are key. Factors including temperature, atmospheric conditions, and even satellite images of the Earth’s surface are considered. It’s complicated, but appealing to mathematicians like Ajne.

Selling for up to $35,000 per kilo, it's revered and relished by aristocrats across the globe. But it's an acquired taste. Turns out, caviar wasn't always so valuable. In the 19th century, sturgeon species in the US were so common that there are accounts of caviar being offered in saloons for free, like bar nuts. In Europe, fishermen were feeding the eggs to their pigs, or leaving it on the beach to spoil. What changed?\n\nSimilar to true champagne, caviar doesn't come from just anywhere. This, for example, is not caviar. To get the real thing, it has to be eggs from a sturgeon. There are 27 species around the world in North America, Europe, and Asia. But probably not for long. \n\nArne Ludwig: In this case, sturgeon will die out because humans are over-harvesting their populations and destroying their habitats.\n\nIn 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature placed 18 species on its Red List of Threatened Species, making the sturgeon the most endangered group of species on Earth. But lists like these are bittersweet. On the one hand, they can help protect the sturgeon from further population decline. On the other hand, the rarer that caviar becomes, the more we can't get enough of it. There's actually an economic idea that explains this. It's called the rarity value thesis and it describes how rarity increases the value of the item. Sturgeon can weigh up to several thousand pounds, and produce hundreds of pounds of roe at a time. The world record belongs to a beluga sturgeon that weighed 2,520 pounds and yielded 900 pounds of roe. Today, she'd be worth about half a million dollars. \n\nIt wasn't until around the 20th century when these freshwater fish and their eggs became a rare commodity. Pollution poisoned their waters and dams blocked their spawning grounds upstream. They had nowhere to reproduce and continued to be overfished for their meat and roe. On top of that, it takes 8-20 years for a female to sexually mature, depending on the species. She can produce millions of eggs at a time, but odds are that only one will survive to adulthood. In the end, the sturgeon population couldn't keep up with demand and their coveted eggs became the jewels of the luxury food scene. Today, caviar imports and exports are closely regulated in the US., which is partly why it's so expensive. \n\nDeborah Keane: People forget that every single egg, every one of these eggs is taken off by hand. Now, remember that we're dealing with a raw seafood endangered species. So it is basically like eating and dealing with edible elephant tusks. It is that heavily regulated.\n\nThat's why today, the majority of caviar comes from sturgeon farms.\n\nDeborah Keane: Little did I know that by 2011, all wild caviar would become illegal on the planet. When I started there were six farms in the world and only two producing caviar in the world and that was in 2004. Now, there are 2,000 farms.\n\nOne farm, in particular, in China called Kaluga Queen produces 35% of the world's caviar. Caviar there is harvested with the classic Russian and Iranian technique, which involves killing the fish and then extracting the eggs. Other farms are exploring a different technique, which doesn't involve killing the fish. It's called stripping. The fish are injected with a hormone that triggers their urge to release eggs. Farmers have been doing this for many years, but not to get caviar — just to produce more fish. It wasn't until recently that people started canning this stuff and selling it as caviar.\n\nDmitrijs Tracuks: The biggest thing is that yes, fish stays alive. You have really small impact on the fish because you do it really fast. You take the fish out of the water, you put it on the special holding facility. The fish has already started to spawn and so all that requires is to press on the belly, massage the belly and the caviar will just flow out of the fish.\n\nThe idea behind no-kill caviar is a commendable one, but it has yet to catch on. Either way, with caviar farms in place, this gives the wild sturgeon population a chance to recover. But whether or not, that happens is largely up to us.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/",5,8,140,401,34,1420833.0

The figure skating jump is legendary among ice skaters, from Tonya Harding's 1991 triple axel to modern icon Mirai Nagasu's attempts in competition. It turns out that the physics of the triple axel makes it a uniquely difficult jump — and one worth learning about.\n\nAs a forward-edge jump, the mechanics of a triple axel requires technical acumen from skaters while they still try to maintain an artistically interesting performance. Pioneers like Midori Ito and Tonya Harding had to jump, ramp up rotation speed, and then land all while trying to look good. This effort set them apart from competitors like Nancy Kerrigan, but it wasn't easy to land a triple axel in competition.\n\nAnd that difficulty might be why the triple axel endures as the pinnacle of figure skating performance — and why it's sure to light up the 2018 Winter Olympics as well.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

The rock's just being compressed underneath.

My woodburning stove is not the most efficient for primary heating, so I show exactly how it functions and what I can do to make it more efficient, saving wood and money in the process. It's interesting to see my dog, Cali the Golden Retriever, show up on the thermal image and how cool she is compared to the surrounding walls, table and bed that she's lying on.\nThe tiny house should be very easy to heat once the pointing (mortar) is done inside and out and I can use what I've learned on this log cabin to help me design and build the other structures on my wilderness homestead. Working and collecting firewood alone is challenging, so I want to maximize the efficiency of each building in order to make this long term off grid survival situation more economically feasible. If I can reduce the amount of fuel needed to heat each off grid building, I can provide all of the energy I need for free from the property. This is going to require the installation of rocket stove (rocket mass heater) to use the wood more efficiently.\nI have a few upcoming diy projects that this thermal scan technology will help with - the bread oven, the sauna, the workshop and the maple sugar shack.\n\nLinks to Products Used: \n\nSolar LED light bulb 15W \nhttp://amzn.to/2BQvSQ2 \n\n\nAgawa Canyon Boreal 21 Saw\nhttp://amzn.to/2BPV6OF\n\nCopper Fairy lights\nhttp://amzn.to/2BCmF0X\n\nSolar String Lights\nhttp://amzn.to/2DvgU2n\n\n\nBanneton 12 round \nhttp://amzn.to/2ByxwsF\n\n Lodge Dutch Oven\nhttp://amzn.to/2kHuxDQ\n\nFlamen heat resistant gloves up to 500 degrees\nhttp://amzn.to/2l1mRMm\n\nRocksheat baking stone\n http://amzn.to/2kF6eql\n\nMora Knife\nhttp://amzn.to/2BOiv35\n\nLamp OiI\nhttp://amzn.to/2qz0nZ1 \n\nWall Lantern (candle lit)\nhttp://amzn.to/2Dpa0MK \n\nMoka Pot\nhttp://amzn.to/2DEomvO  Canada\nhttp://amzn.to/2ndmtw6  USA\n\nCanon 6D\nhttp://amzn.to/2EdaZjs\n\nDJI Mavic Pro\nhttp://amzn.to/2DHuJib\n\nBragg's Sprinkle\nhttp://amzn.to/2EdouzK\n\nTo see what I’m up to during the rest of the week, please follow me on my other online channels;\n\nWebsite: http://myselfreliance.com/\nFacebook – https://www.facebook.com/MySelfReliance/\nPersonal Facebook Page (Shawn James) – https://www.facebook.com/shawn.james.msr\nInstagram – https://www.instagram.com/myselfreliance/\n\nMailing Address:\nP.O.

Only discovered in 2005, not much is known about these insects, but they are believed to be most active at night when their deep black coloration keeps them hidden from predators. They are also armed with a gland at the rear of their heads which, when threatened, can spray a corrosive, strong-smelling substance. Because their natural habitat is so small, their survival is precarious—thankfully, captive breeding efforts may bring these insects back from the brink.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://goo.gl/vR6Acb\n\nThis story is a part of our Planet Earth series.

If I consumed even the smallest amounts of lactose I'd be violently ill within the hour. So as I was choosing my university I vowed that one day I'd fix it.\n\nRecently my friend Gabriel Licina, renowned biohacker and genetic engineer, gave me access to the tools and materials I needed to make a therapy that could potentially fix the issue. The therapy uses a virus called an AAV to deliver DNA that codes for the enzyme that breaks down lactose. When packaged into a pill and ingested, the virus should induce my intestine to produce lactase, effectively restoring lactose tolerance.\n\nThis project was based on research done by other scientists and I've included links to all the papers below. I've also included links to all of the places I got the viral DNA kits from. The other reagents and media were all purchased from the thermofisher catalogue. \n\nI'm also working on a writeup of this procedure and will hopefully publish a paper on the results once I've collected more data. I know that so far my sample size is still only N=1 but my life has changed from this project and I wanted to share my progress. I'm not going to make any claims about the project other than my life seems to have improved. \n\nThis is for educational purposes only. Do not attempt anything you see, unless you are an experienced biologist. \n\n__________________________________________________________________\nResources:\n\nOriginal paper: http://sci-hub.la/10.1038/2625\npAAVLacz Plasmid: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/paav-lacz-control-plasmid\nAAV kit: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/aav-2-cmv-expression-system\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInterested in some sweet science themed designs for your wardrobe or wall?

But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.  \n\n“Ready Player One” stars Tye Sheridan (“X-Men: Apocalypse,” “Mud”), Olivia Cooke (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” “Bates Motel”), Ben Mendelsohn (“Rogue One – A Star Wars Story,” “Bloodline”) and T.J. Miller (“Deadpool,” “Silicon Valley”), with Simon Pegg (the “Star Trek” movies, the “Mission: Impossible” movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (“Bridge of Spies,” “Dunkirk”).  \n\nBehind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”) reunited his creative team from “Bridge of Spies,” including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (“Saving Private Ryan,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark”) and Sarah Broshar (“The Post”), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (“Moonrise Kingdom”).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the “Back to the Future” films, “Forrest Gump”).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, “Ready Player One.”\n\nSlated for release on March 29, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.",9,9,20,155,30,5029965.0

Today, music is an essential part of the sport and there’s a hidden strategy behind how they pick their songs. For a long time, figure skaters skated to classics like Carmen, Swan Lake, and Don Quixote. Not only because it’s great music but because of the clear story line and the dynamic characters in them. \n\nBut this is all changing. In 2014, the ISU changed the music rules to allow skaters to skate to music with lyrics. Now with a wider range of music to choose from — some skaters like Jimmy Ma have traded in Bizet for Lil Jon.

We used 2 teaspoons of shea butter and 1 teaspoon of cocoa butter. Mix. \nTip: Use less shea butter and cocoa butter for a more pigmented lip balm, and more shea butter and cocoa butter for a more subtle tinted lip balm. \nPour the mixture into a container and let it sit to cool. \nUse like a regular lip balm. \n\n\nCandle Melts\n\nMATERIALS\nTweezers\nAlmost empty candle jars\nSilicone mold\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nPlace your candle jar into a pot filled with hot water (with the water line not passing the middle of the jar) and allow the wax to melt completely. \nRemove any wicks with a pair of tweezers. \nCarefully remove the candle jar from the hot water and pour the melted wax into the silicone mold. \nLet the candle wax harden completely. \nEnjoy by using in a candle warmer. \n\n\nMustard Salad Dressing\n\nMATERIALS\nAlmost empty mustard bottle\nHoney\nOlive oil\nApple cider vinegar\nSalt \nPepper\n\n \nINSTRUCTIONS \nIf you’re having trouble getting use out of the mustard at the bottom of the bottle, this is perfect for you! Open the top of the bottle and pour in the ingredients necessary to make a delicious salad dressing. We went for a basic mustard vinaigrette using honey (to taste), 3 parts olive oil, one part apple cider vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. \nOptional: Add other herbs for extra flavor. \nSeal the bottle back up and shake it to mix the ingredients. The bottle itself will act as a perfect container to pour out the dressing. Store in the refrigerator for up to 4 months. \n\n\nScented Epsom Salt\n\nMATERIALS\nEpsom salt\nEmpty essential oil bottle\nTweezers\nContainer (that fits the epsom salt) \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nPour epsom salt into a resealable container. \nOpen up the bottle of essential oil and separate its parts as necessary. \nPlace the pieces of the essential oil bottle inside the epsom salt, with the salt completely covering the parts of the bottle. Close the container and give it a shake. \nLeave for 24 hours. \nAll of the essential oil residue that was left inside the empty bottle will have been absorbed by the epsom salt, leaving behind a deliciously scented epsom salt. \n\n\nNail Polish Marbling\n\nMATERIALS\nPlastic container\nNail polish\nPointed stirring stick or wooden skewer\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nFill your plastic container approximately halfway with warm water. \nSwirl nail polish over it, use your stick to create a design. Work quickly to ensure that the nail polish doesn’t get too tacky (this makes marbling more difficult). \nSlowly press the object that you would like to marble into the nail polish, and carefully flip it out to keep the nail polish from sliding off of the surface. Let it dry completely before using, and enjoy! \nOptional: Apply a sealant over the nail polish to make the design permanent. \n\n\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/47724\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network",7,8,126,476,31,577026.0

But rather than feed the fire of an old flame, Alvin Cailan is teaming up with YouTube legend Andrew Rea (Binging With Babish) to teach people how to make both of these iconic burgers at home. Better yet, they've devised the ultimate peace treaty: a Double Shack x Double-Double Animal-style Voltron burger. It's a moment in burger history you won't want to miss.  \n\nFirst We Feast's The Burger Show is a new web series that explores everything about modern burger culture—from the rise of Instagram-bait stunt burgers, to the enduring influence of regional styles—through the eyes of Eggslut chef, Alvin Cailan. Alvin's breakfast-sandwich empire in Los Angeles put him on the culinary map, but it's burgers that are his true passion. Now he's in NYC to understand what drives his obsession, and he's linking up with folks like Adam Richman, Matty Matheson, and Binging With Babish's Andrew Rea to help him along the way.\n\nSubscribe to First We Feast on YouTube: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\n\n\nFirst We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country's best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect.",7,7,126,717,28,2871344.0

With a fresh sound that mixes old-school soul vocals and R&B beats, the Colombian singer caught the attention of hip-hop artists such as Snoop Dogg and Tyler, The Creator. Uchis has since built a resume of additional collaborations with Tyler, Miguel, and Latin music superstar Juanes. She also grabbed her first Grammy nomination this year for Best R&B Performance, as a feature on Daniel Caesar’s track “Get You.”\n\nUchis' latest hit is the retro-sounding and smooth single “After The Storm,” featuring Tyler and funk legend Bootsy Collins. Racking in over 6 million streams on YouTube, the song tackles themes of survival and inner conflict. Uchis also references her own personal difficulties of living U.S., far away from her Colombian family members.\n\nRead more on Genius: https://genius.com/a/kali-uchis-breaks-down-official-lyrics-for-after-the-storm-on-genius-video-series-verified\n\nRead all the lyrics to After The Storm on Genius: https://genius.com/Kali-uchis-after-the-storm-lyrics\n\nSubscribe to Genius: http://bit.ly/2cNV6nz\nGenius on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Genius\nGenius on Instagram: http://instagram.com/genius\nGenius on Facebook: https://facebook.com/Geniusdotcom\nhttp://genius.com",7,14,44,186,26,2282860.0

People are also underestimating The Guardians of the Galaxy and the pop that will bring to IW since a lot of people didn’t know they are even apart of the avengers. Thoughts?\n\nRaymundo Lopez - Black Panther is now the MCU’s highest opening weekend for a stand alone movie.

Do you also think this puts to rest the talks that the MCU needs to reboot after Thanos?\n\nJosh DeRose - After numerous false starts, it appears as though NBC might finally be moving forward with a companion series for The Office.

Unfortunately, there are some who are attacking these young people and calling them actors and “fake news.” Well known people like Donald Trump Jr. and Ted Nugent are perpetuating these lies and we can’t just sit there and let these scumbags spread lies about children who survived a shooting a week ago.\n\nGuillermo at NBA All-Star Media Day 2018 – Finding LeBron https://youtu.be/50Z5msbmEmg\n \nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest #KIMMEL: http://bit.ly/JKLSubscribe\n \nWatch Mean Tweets: http://bit.ly/KimmelMT10\n \nConnect with Jimmy Kimmel Live Online:\n \nVisit the Jimmy Kimmel Live WEBSITE: http://bit.ly/JKLWebsite\nLike Jimmy Kimmel on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/KimmelFB\nLike Jimmy Kimmel Live on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/JKLFacebook\nFollow @JimmyKimmel on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/KimmelTW\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/JKLTwitter\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on INSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/JKLInstagram\n \nAbout Jimmy Kimmel Live:\n \nJimmy Kimmel serves as host and executive producer of Emmy-winning Jimmy Kimmel Live, ABC's late-night talk show.\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live is well known for its huge viral video successes with 5.6 billion views on YouTube alone.\nSome of Kimmel's most popular comedy bits include - Mean Tweets, Lie Witness News, Jimmy's Twerk Fail Prank, Unnecessary Censorship, YouTube Challenge, The Baby Bachelor, Movie: The Movie, Handsome Men's Club, Jimmy Kimmel Lie Detective and music videos like I (Wanna) Channing All Over Your Tatum and a Blurred Lines parody with Robin Thicke, Pharrell, Jimmy and his security guard Guillermo.\nNow in its sixteenth season, Kimmel's guests have included: Johnny Depp, Meryl Streep, Tom Cruise, Halle Berry, Harrison Ford, Jennifer Aniston, Will Ferrell, Katy Perry, Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, George Clooney, Larry David, Charlize Theron, Mark Wahlberg, Kobe Bryant, Steve Carell, Hugh Jackman, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Bridges, Jennifer Garner, Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston, Jamie Foxx, Amy Poehler, Ben Affleck, Robert Downey Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal, Oprah, and unfortunately Matt Damon.\n\nJimmy Kimmel on Florida Shooting Survivors Being Called Fake News\nhttps://youtu.be/x3ch1ajtwbc",1,1,488,1801,23,11259007.0

D grows up under the wing of a Kingston Don and music producer named King Fox (Sheldon Shepherd). Fox dispatches him to London, where he reconnects with his childhood sweetheart, Yvonne (Shantol Jackson), and his daughter who he's not seen since she was a baby. He also hooks up with a soundclash crew, called High Noon. But before he can be convinced to abandon his life of crime and follow the righteous path, he encounters the man who shot his brother 10 years earlier, and embarks on a bloody, explosive quest for retribution - a quest which brings him into conflict with vicious London gangster Rico (Stephen Graham).\n\nFollow the Yardie film channels for more updates:\n\nfacebook.com/YardieFilm \ntwitter.com/YardieFilm\ninstagram.com/YardieFilm",7,7,3,5,2,59581.0

For the past 5 weeks, I've been working in the ICU, facing so much death and so many grieving families... at times it has been incredibly difficult. There often isn't time to process your emotions during the day while you are working and these experiences can build up.\n\nThe question becomes: how do you process these experiences in a healthy way? I believe this happens on many levels. \nFirst is at the level of the team, with debriefing and discussions. In the ICU we actually do some formal sessions after challenging codes (when a patient's heart stops or they stop breathing) with all the doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists and students. \nThen it's important to figure out what works best for you - do you process thoughts through journaling? exercising? blogging? \nPersonally I find talking to trusted friends, family and colleagues is the best way for me to process my thoughts and emotions.\n\nI want this video to remind you to TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF and to LOOK OUT FOR OTHERS who may be struggling! We all experience highs and lows in life. \n\nThank you so much for watching! I know this was a heavy topic and different than my usual vlogs in hospital. I believe it's a crucial topic and I hope you enjoyed it!\n\nCOMMENT BELOW - I am really looking forward to having a conversation with you guys and hearing your thoughts!\n\nSUBSCRIBE to experience more of my journey as a junior doctor! \n\n~ Siobhan (aka Violin MD) ~\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n♫ Background Music ♫ \n\nRhodesia by Twin Musicom is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nArtist: http://www.twinmusicom.org/\n\nBrahms Symphony No. 3 - Scherzo",9,9,2,22,21,64575.0

Push notifications buzz in your pocket, red bubbles demand attention, and endless distractions sit at your fingertips. It can feel impossible to pull away from. But that’s kind of the point. When people talk about the “attention economy,” they’re referring to the fact that your time and attention are the currency on which today’s applications make money. Because apps profit off of the total time you spend on their platform, there’s a strong incentive to use psychological tricks  to keep you endlessly hooked. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Tristan Harris, who runs Time Well Spent, is working to create a world where platforms can more honestly respect their users’ time. \n\nBy Design is a new Vox video series about the intersection of design and technology, hosted by Christophe Haubursin.

Such shelves are important because they hold back a vast amount of ice. If all such West Antarctic shelves were to collapse and spill the ice into the ocean then global sea level would rise by 10 feet. Beneath the Ross Ice Shelf is one of the least explored bits of ocean on Earth. New Zealand scientists used a hot-water drill hose to create a hole through the thick ice until they reached the perpetually dark water. They hoped to study the health and history of the shelf. Their findings surprised them. They found that the ice in the hole itself and along the base of the shelf was crystalizing and freezing rather than melting. Measurements will be taken for the next few years, to see how the Ross Ice Shelf is changing over time.\n\nRead more in Deep Bore Into Antarctica Finds Freezing Ice, Not Melting as Expected\n\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/ross-ice-shelf-bore-antarctica-freezing/\n\nDeep Bore Into Antarctica Finds Freezing Ice, Not Melting as Expected | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/fyjt5zpNAeg\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo",6,9,140,489,35,7552015.0

From what I can tell, it's able to produce models at a level of details as good as, if not better, than the Form 2. That's crazy. The process of printing and finishing models isn't as refined as the Form 2, however, you aren't paying as much for the printer.

It's a formula that's spawned a wave of Stunt Food—food whose sole purpose is to rack up likes on your Instagram feed. Chefs may not crave this kind of food, but it's no secret that they're also natural competitors. When they see something on their social feed, their first instinct is to say I can do it better. So in the spirit of duking it out in the kitchen, Alvin goes head-to-head with Top Chef alum Ilan Hall to see who has the chops to make the craziest, most gonzo Stunt Burger. And they've got an all-star panel of judges—Sean Evans, Matty Matheson, Miss Info—to see if they've gone too far. \n\nFirst We Feast's The Burger Show is a new web series that explores everything about modern burger culture—from the rise of Instagram-bait stunt burgers, to the enduring influence of regional styles—through the eyes of Eggslut chef, Alvin Cailan. Alvin's breakfast-sandwich empire in Los Angeles put him on the culinary map, but it's burgers that are his true passion. Now he's in NYC to understand what drives his obsession, and he's linking up with folks like Padma Lakshmi, Matty Matheson, and Binging With Babish's Andrew Rea to help him along the way.\n\nSubscribe to First We Feast on YouTube: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\n\n\nFirst We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country's best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect.",2,2,126,730,27,2871344.0

It was also surprisingly smart.\n\nWWII saw another kind of strange history unfold: a meme (yes, really). Watch our video on it here: http://bit.ly/2Co9DEu\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nDazzle camouflage was a surprisingly effective defense against torpedoes. In this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explains why.\n\n\nWorld War I ships faced a unique problem. The u-boat was a new threat at the time, and its torpedoes were deadly. That led artist Norman Wilkinson to come up with dazzle camouflage (sometimes called “razzle dazzle camouflage”). The idea was to confuse u-boats about a ship’s course, rather than try to conceal its presence. In doing so, dazzle camouflage could keep torpedoes from hitting the boat — and that and other strategies proved a boon in World War I.\n\n\nThis camouflage is unusual, but its striking appearance influenced the culture, inspired cubist painters’ riffs, and even entered into the world of fashion. Though dazzle camouflage lost its utility once radar and other detection techniques took over from u-boat periscopes, for a brief period in time it was an effective and unusual way to help ships stay safe.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

The 18th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe declined only 46%, beating other record holders Jurassic World at $106.6 million, and 2012’s The Avengers with $103 million.\n\nAs soon as news broke that Joss Whedon would be leaving The Batgirl adaptation at DC Films, two acclaimed female writers took to their social media, throwing their hats in the ring.\n\nIn a new interview with Kristopher Tapley on Variety’s Playback podcast, Ryan Coogler confirmed the reason he’s not directing Creed 2. In the in depth interview, Coogler touched on how personal the movie Creed was, and how it truly was a story about his own father, before explaining: “There’s timing, and that film for whatever reason it had to go when it’s going.”\n\nZac Efron took to his Instagram to share some of the first looks of him and the cast of the Ted Bundy biopic entitled Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile. The images show Efron in a number of behind the scenes looks, as well as working alongside The Big Bang Theory star Jim Parson.\n\nIn a recent Reddit AMA with director Alex Garland and his latest, Annihilation, Garland revealed that another adaptation of his novel The Beach was in the works with “someone very talented.”\n\nStudio Canal UK released the first trailer for Sundance thriller Yardie, marking the feature directorial debut of Idris Elba. Set in ’70s Kingston and ’80s Hackney, Yardie centers on the life of a young Jamaican man named D.\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Perri: https://twitter.com/PNemiroff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider is more than an essential destination.

And yet even after West Virginia University discovered the corruption, VW wouldn't announce that the defeat device worked until it had been proven again through testing by the California Air Resources Board.

See the film in theatres this Thanksgiving.\n\n“Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2” leaves Litwak’s video arcade behind, venturing into the uncharted, expansive and thrilling world of the internet—which may or may not survive Ralph’s wrecking. Video game bad guy Ralph (voice of John C. Reilly) and fellow misfit Vanellope von Schweetz (voice of Sarah Silverman) must risk it all by traveling to the world wide web in search of a replacement part to save Vanellope’s video game, Sugar Rush. In way over their heads, Ralph and Vanellope rely on the citizens of the internet—the netizens—to help navigate their way, including a webite entrepreneur named Yesss (voice of Taraji P. Henson), who is the head algorithm and the heart and soul of trend-making site “BuzzzTube.” Directed by Rich Moore (“Zootopia,” “Wreck-It Ralph”) and Phil Johnston (co-writer “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Cedar Rapids,” co-writer “Zootopia,”), and produced by Clark Spencer (“Zootopia,” “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Bolt”), “Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-Ralph 2” hits theaters on Nov. 21, 2018.\n\nSee more from official Disney Animation:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimation\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/disneyanimation\n\nWelcome to the official Walt Disney Animation Studios YouTube channel!

Set during the final week of Jesus' life, the story is told from the perspective of infamous betrayer Judas Iscariot.

Check out our expert analysis at Vox: http://bit.ly/2F7xfyW\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nMethod acting's foundational theory originated in the Soviet Union during the early 20th century. It was created by Konstantin Stanislavski and his peers at the Moscow Art Theater as a framework for systematically training young actors. Method acting became influential in the US in the ’30s and ’40s, pioneered by Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, and Sanford Meisner, each of whom transformed and built on Stanislavski’s system.\n\nToday, training in method acting is ubiquitous for aspiring actors. But at the same time, the stakes of method acting continue to rise. First popularized in the US during the 1950s by Marlon Brando's generation of Hollywood stars, method acting continues to be a consistent way for actors to push themselves in new roles. But while method acting won Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar for his performance in The Revenant, it's undeniable that the way method acting is promoted is conspicuously marketable. Still, it has undoubtedly led to some of the greatest performances of all time.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

I like faster/louder triggers and roleplays, so I realized that I don't tend to slow it down in many of my videos. This video is the opposite!

I can totally relate with that, and ASMR is an awesome outlet for those things. However, if you’re interested, above is a link to a website with real, professional & licensed counselors. You can type to them, or call them! It’s actually a really cool service and I use it personally.
